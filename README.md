Strano [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/joelmoss/strano.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joelmoss/strano)
======

The Github backed Capistrano deployment management UI.

Strano allows you to run any capistrano task via a clean and simple web interface. Simply create a project from any of your Github repositories, and Strano will use the Capistrano configuration within the repository itself. Which means you don't have to set up Capistrano twice, and you can still run capistrano tasks from the
command line without fear of different configurations being used, causing conflicted deploys.

All tasks are recorded, so you can look back and see a full history of who did what and when. I also plan on creating a Capistrano plugin, that will record all command line task activity with Strano. Which means your task history will also include the tasks that you ran on the command line.

Strano is in production use at ShermansTravel, but is still in active development. So I need your help to improve and ensure the code is top quality. So I encourage any and all pull requests. Fork away!

Installation
------------

Strano is simply a Rails app with a Sidekiq backend for processing background jobs. Clone the repo from [Github](https://github.com/joelmoss/strano) and run:

    script/bootstrap

Then start the app:

    bundle exec rails s

**NOTE** Strano cannot be run on Heroku, as the project repositories have to cloned to a local directory in your app at `vendors/repos`.


Configuration
-------------

Strano requires that you define only three configuration variables. The rest are optional, but can be overridden. You can either create a config/strano.yml configuration file and define them in there, or you can define them in the `ENV` variable. See `config/strano.example.yml` for all possible configuration variables.

The following are required and should be defined before running Strano.

- Github Key and Secret

  Create a [Github application](https://github.com/settings/applications) and copy the generated key and secret to: `github_key` and `github_secret`.

- Public SSH key

  In order to clone repositories from Github, it requires a public SSH key be defined in `public_ssh_key`.


Background Processing
---------------------

Background processing of tasks and repo management is taken care of by the excellent [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq). Run
the queue like this:

    bundle exec sidekiq

You can then monitor your queue at `http://YOUR-STRANO-APP/sidekiq`. Check out the [Sidekiq Wiki](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki) for assistance on Sidekiq and its options.
